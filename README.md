## What I did:
* The user can enter a city name or city,state (with no spaces around the comma and the state needs to be a 2 letter state)
* The city is saved in local storage and added to a clickable list for quick access
* The current weather is displayed and under it the 5 day forcast
* The 5 day forcast is color coded based on the weather conditions
* The uv index is color coded based on how high. It is green, yellow, orange, red, purple from lowest to heighest.
